NEWS for R Package "MGBT"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.2 -- 2019-10-11 (2nd CRAN Presubmission Review Reconciliations)
1.  The CRAN team provided additional critique requiring GGBK.R to be modified
      to issue a stop() instead of warning();return(NULL). The GGBK.Rd example
      was not modified to a \donttest{} from \dontrun{} as per CRAN advice because
      the stop() would cause "R CMD check --as-cran --run-donttest" to FAIL.
2.  Converted \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in CritK.Rd.
3.  Converted \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in RthOrderPValueOrthoT.Rd.
      Some modification to arguments in the Examples made to keep reasonable
      run times when --run-donttest is used. Notes were made to TAC's original
      settings in these examples where needed.
4.  Converted \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in RSlo.Rd, but slight modification
      to the used r-order statistics. Sample size kept at n=100, but the maximum
      order statistic in is maxr=n/10 instead of n/2, which was the entire lower
      tail. This is done so that forced testing of the example can still be
      reasonably completed when --run-donttest is used. Notes were made to TAC's
      original settings in the example.
5.  Converted \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in critK10.Rd. However, one \dontrun{}
      is deliberately retained because the original example uses the GGBK(),
      which now issues a stop().
6.  Converted \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in makeWaterYear.Rd, plotFFQevol.Rd,
      plotPeaks.Rd, and splitPeakCodes.Rd.
7.  Added dataRetrieval to the DESCRIPTION:Suggests. 
8.  Added USGS NWIS citation to makeWaterYear.Rd, plotPeaks.Rd, and
      splitPeakCodes.Rd.
9.  Reversed the ordering of this NEWS.


1.0.1 -- 2019-10-01 (1st CRAN Presubmission Review Reconciliations)
1.  Added two references and DOI numbers to the DESCRIPTION:Description.
2.  Opened up EMS.Rd to the running of its examples.
3.  Added note about very long run times for some of the \dontrun{} remaining for
      RSlo.Rd and RthOrderPValueOrthoT.Rd.
4.  Switched selected \dontrun{} to \donttest{} in documentation files BLlo.Rd,
      critK10.Rd (also added another example that does not use the GGBK),
      MGBT.Rd, MGBT-package.Rd, and RthOrderPValueOrthoT.Rd.
5.  Confirmed passage of R CMD check --as-cran --run-donttest MGBT
6.  Added note about the deliberate non-need of the dataRetrieval package for MGBT
      related to the \dontrun{} use in makeWaterYear.Rd, plotPeaks.Rd, and
      splitPeakCodes.Rd.
7.  Added pairing of opar <- par(no.readonly=TRUE) ... on.exit(par(opar))
      in plotPeaks.R and added xlab/ylab in the plotPeaks.Rd \dontrun{} examples.
8.  Added pairing of the following commands in plotFFQevol.Rd for restoration of 
      defaults:  opts <- options(scipen=7)     ...  options(opts)
                 opar <- par(no.readonly=TRUE) ...  par(opar)
9.  Added path=tempdir() in plotFFQevol.R with argument silent message() of file 
      locations.


1.0.0 -- 2019-09-25
1.  First attempt for a CRAN release (GitLab tagged "v1.0.0")


0.9.9 -- 2019-09-24
1.  Preparing various files for the prospect of being publically available as
      approved software by USGS along https://code.usgs.gov/water/stats/MGBT.


0.9.4 -- 2019-08-28
1.  Adjusted plotPeaks.R/Rd with coordination with Nancy Barth, to use D as the
      plotting character instead of the diamond, and updated ./inst/legend accordingly.
2.  Adjusted beginning of the suite of MGBT*() functions to test for as.data.frame and
      then attempt to extract a peak_va columns and added as.numeric conversion. This
      accelerates using the MGBT() functions with data directly from USGS NWIS.


0.9.3 -- 2019-08-13
1.  Adjustments to supporting files (not .R or .Rd) in preparation for bureau approval
      in parallel to working on the DOI number.


0.9.2 -- 2019-08-05
1.  Adjustments to supporting files (not .R or .Rd) in preparation for bureau approval.


0.9.1 -- 2019-07-30
1.  Auditing package README files as further preparation for publication.
2.  Added the zzz.R for the .onAttach().


0.7.9 -- 2019-07-27
1.  Added as.numeric() casing of gage_ht inside splitPeakCodes().
2.  Made many extensions to README.md in response to Nancy Barth peer review along with
      phone discussions with John England (2019-05-26).


0.7.8 -- 2019-07-25
1.  Added support for the "O" discharge qualification code that was brought to the
      authors' attention by Nancy Barth. Documentation upgrade in MGBT-package.Rd from
      John England recommendations.


0.7.7 -- 2019-05-21
1.  Added more features to plotPeaks() to plot more nuances of the peak database
      related to presence of gage height but no discharge and plotting when double
      missing discharge and gage height exists.


0.7.6 -- 2019-03-30
1.  Another editing pass on the documentation.


0.7.5 -- 2019-02-27
1. Added warning to multiple gages in splitPeakCodes() and early return NULL.
     This is related to data-mining scale testing on a project of one of the authors.
     Also minor adjustments to splitPeakCodes.Rd.


0.7.4 -- 2019-02-01
1.  Corrected the terminal year in splitPeakCodes().


0.7.3--Documentation audit.


0.7.2 -â€” Manually plotting the vertical axes in plotPeaks().


0.7.1 -- Slight interfacing fix in plotPeaks().


0.0.6 -- Continued interest in the project during summer 2018
1.  Added plotPeaks(), makeWaterYear(), and makeWaterYear().
2.  The lmomco package suggested as it is needed for plotPeaks().


0.0.1 -- Creation of the project during summer 2017
